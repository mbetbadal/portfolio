### Rewrite steps for clarity and add example for "Creating jobs in a project"

Scheduled and hosted a call with STSM and 2 design focals to learn about the Scheduling jobs UI and address concerns over a complex feature and the correlating lack of clarity in the documentation. As a result, I updated the ‚ÄúCreating and managing jobs‚Äù topic with clear language, accurate steps, and an additional example to help our users understand a complex feature.
